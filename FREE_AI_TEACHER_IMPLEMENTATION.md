   - Seamless switching between modes

3. **API Endpoints** (existing routes work unchanged)
   - `/api/ai-teacher` - Main teaching endpoint
   - Session management and conversation history
   - Drawing instruction processing

### **Knowledge Base Structure**
```typescript
// Example: Mathematics Knowledge Base
Mathematics → {
  Addition: Step-by-step examples + visual arrays
  Multiplication: Repeated addition + grid diagrams  
  Fractions: Pizza slice visualizations
  Geometry: Shape drawings and measurements
  Algebra: Equation solving with examples
}
```

## 🎯 **Usage Examples**

### **1. Mathematics Learning**
- **Question**: "Help me understand fractions"
- **Response**: Interactive pizza slice diagrams with 1/2, 1/4 explanations
- **Visuals**: Circle divided into parts with labels

### **2. Science Exploration**
- **Question**: "What is photosynthesis?"
- **Response**: Plant biology explanation with sunlight → glucose process
- **Visuals**: Leaf diagram showing CO₂ + H₂O + Light = Glucose + O₂

### **3. Programming Tutorials**
- **Question**: "How do I create a variable in Python?"
- **Response**: Syntax examples with practical use cases
- **Visuals**: Code blocks with step-by-step breakdown

### **4. Historical Learning**
- **Question**: "Tell me about the pyramids"
- **Response**: Ancient Egypt timeline with construction methods
- **Visuals**: Pyramid diagrams and historical timeline

## 🌟 **Advantages Over Paid APIs**

### **Cost Benefits**
